## SpringBoot-Security-with-JWT

This repository demonstrates how to implement robust authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot application using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

# Key Features

- **Secure authentication:** Leverages JWTs for token-based authentication and user verification.
- **Role-based authorization:** Protects resources based on user roles, fine-tuning access control.
- **Customizable configuration:** Adjusts security settings to fit your specific needs.
- **Best practices:** Adheres to recommended practices for secure Spring Boot development.

# Getting Started

 **Prerequisites:**
   - Java 8 or later
   - Maven or Gradle
   - A preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)

 **Clone the repository:**

   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/SpringBoot-Security-with-JWT.git

**Build and run:**
Maven:

cd SpringBoot-Security-with-JWT
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
Use code with caution. 

Gradle:

cd SpringBoot-Security-with-JWT
gradle clean build
gradle bootRun
Use code with caution. 

# Access the application:
The application typically starts on http://localhost:8080 (or a specified port).
Usage

**Protected resources:**
Endpoints requiring authentication will be secured using JWTs.
**Configuration**
Security settings: Modify security-related configurations in application.properties or application.yml.
Authentication manager: Customize the CustomAuthenticationManager class for tailored authentication logic.
**Additional Features:**
Exception handling: Handles security-related exceptions gracefully.
Token validation: Verifies JWT signatures and expiration.
Refresh tokens: Implements refresh token functionality for extended sessions.
